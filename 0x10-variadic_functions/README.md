   DESCRIPTION ABOUT C - Variadic functions

A variadic function is a function that accepts a variable number of arguments. In C, we use the <stdarg.h> header to define and manipulate such functions.
In C programming language, a variadic function is a function that takes a variable number of arguments. Variadic functions are defined using the ellipsis ... syntax.

The most commonly used variadic function in C is printf(), which takes a variable number of arguments based on the format string. Another example is the scanf() function, which also takes a variable number of arguments based on the format string.

To define a variadic function, you use the va_list type, along with the va_start(), va_arg(), and va_end() macros. The va_list type is used to declare a variable that will hold the arguments passed to the function, and the va_start() macro initializes the va_list variable. The va_arg() macro is used to retrieve the next argument from the va_list, and the va_end() macro cleans up the va_list when the function is finished.
