Language for writing procedural programs is C. Dennis Ritchie first created it between 1969 and 1973.
It was primarily created as an operating system programming language. 
Low-level memory access, a small set of keywords, and a clean style are the three primary characteristics of the C programming language,
which makes it ideal for system programming like operating system or compiler development.

Data structures, algorithms, and Linux/Unix system programming are all types of low-level programming.

The programs in this repository were created for ALX Africa's low-level programming and algorithm track. I gained knowledge of data structures, algorithms, and other low-level programming principles while working on these projects, which took place across the Year 1 curriculum. The following is a detailed list of the projects:

0x00. C - Hello, World

0x01. C - Variables, if, else, while

0x02. C - Functions, nested loops

0x03. C - More functions, more nested loops

0x04. C - Pointers, arrays and strings

0x05. C - More pointers, arrays and strings

0x06. C - Even more pointers, arrays and strings

0x07. C - Recursion

0x08. C - Static libraries

0x09. C - argc, argv

0x0A. C - malloc, free

0x0B. C - More malloc, free

0x0C. C - Preprocessor

0x0D. C - Structures, typedef

0x0E. C - Function pointers

0x0F. C - Variadic functions

0x10. C - printf

0x11. C - Singly linked lists

0x12. C - More singly linked lists

0x13. C - Bit manipulation

0x14. C - File I/O

0x15. C - Simple Shell

0x16. C - Doubly linked lists

0x17. C - Dynamic libraries

0x18. C - Stacks, Queues - LIFO, FIFO

0x19. C - Hash tables

0x1A. C - Sorting algorithms & Big O

0x1B. C - Makefiles

0x1C. C - Binary trees

0x1D. C - Search Algorithms
