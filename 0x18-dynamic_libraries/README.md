# C - Dynamic libraries
# Done by Temesgen Abdissa

# description: Dynamic libraries, denoted as C - Dynamic libraries, are an essential component of the C programming language, providing a mechanism for code reusability and efficient memory management. These libraries consist of precompiled functions and modules that can be dynamically linked to a program during runtime, allowing multiple programs to share the same code. By utilizing dynamic libraries, developers can avoid redundant code duplication, resulting in smaller executable files and improved program performance. Furthermore, the dynamic linking approach enables updates or bug fixes to the library without requiring recompilation of the entire program. Overall, C - Dynamic libraries enhance code modularity, promote code sharing, and contribute to the efficiency and scalability of C-based applications.
