# C - Doubly linked lists
# Done by Temesgen Abdissa
C - Doubly linked lists are a data structure that allows efficient traversal and manipulation of elements in both forward and backward directions. Each node in the list contains two pointers, one pointing to the previous node and another pointing to the next node. This bidirectional linkage enables easy insertion, deletion, and modification of nodes within the list. By maintaining references to both the previous and next nodes, doubly linked lists offer greater flexibility compared to singly linked lists, at the cost of slightly increased memory overhead. They find applications in various scenarios where efficient traversal in both directions is required,such as implementing deque (double-ended queue) data structures or managing sorted data efficiently. In C, doubly linked lists can be implemented by defining a struct to represent each node and properly updating the pointers during list operations.
