# Description About hash tables

C - Hash tables, also known as hash maps, are an essential data structure in computer science used to efficiently store and retrieve key-value pairs. They provide constant-time average case complexity for insertion, deletion, and search operations, making them ideal for tasks that require fast access to data. Hash tables work by utilizing a hash function that converts a given key into an index within an array, where the corresponding value is stored. This indexing mechanism allows for rapid look-up and retrieval, even with a large number of elements. To handle collisions, when two keys hash to the same index, various collision resolution techniques like chaining or open addressing are employed. Hash tables find applications in numerous domains, including databases, caches, compilers, and network routing algorithms, playing a vital role in optimizing performance and efficiency in many software systems.
