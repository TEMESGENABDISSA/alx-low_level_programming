short description about pointer,array, and string in c programming languages.

All the task in this directories tell us how we write a progra using pointer,array ,string and how to solve problems.
A pointer contains the address of an object (or is a null pointer that doesn't point to any object). A pointer has a specific type that indicates the type of object it can point to.
An array is a contiguous ordered sequence of elements; each element is an object, and all the elements of an array are of the same type.
A string is defined as "a contiguous sequence of characters terminated by and including the first null character". C has no string type. A string is a data layout, not a data type.
