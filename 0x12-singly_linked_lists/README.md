      DESCRIPTION  ABOUT 0x12. C - Singly linked lists
      
      A linked list is a linear grouping of data pieces whose physical arrangement in memory does not determine their order. 
      Instead, every part relates to the one before it. 
      It is a data structure made up of a number of nodes that collectively stand for a sequence. 
      Each node includes data and a reference (also known as a link) to the following node in the sequence in its most basic form.

 GIVEN TASKS DEPEND ON  C - Singly linked lists

0. Print list
    0-print_list.c: C function that prints all the elements of a list_t list.
        If str is NULL, the function prints [0] (nil).

1. List length
    1-list_len.c: C function that returns the number of elements in a linked list_t list.

2. Add node
    2-add_node.c: C function that adds a new node at the beginning a of a list_t list.
        If the function fails - returns NULL.
        Otherwise - returns the address of the new element.

3. Add node at the end
    3-add_node_end.c: C function that adds a new node at the end of a linked list_t list.
        If the function fails - returns NULL.
        Otherwise - returns the address of the new element.

4. Free list
    4-free_list.c: C function that frees a list_t list.

5. The Hare and the Tortoise
    100-first.c: C function that prints You're beat! and yet, you must allow,\nI bore my house upon my back!\n before the main function is executed.

6. Real programmers can write assembly code in any language
  101-hello_holberton.asm:64-but assembly program that prints Hello, Holberton followed by a new line using only the printf function witout interrupts.
